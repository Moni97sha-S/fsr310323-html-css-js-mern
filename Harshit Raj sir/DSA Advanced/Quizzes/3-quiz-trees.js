// D) Width

// Res: B) Depth
// Reason:

// Q-2 The number of edges from the node to the deepest leaf is called _________ of the tree.

// A) Height

// C) Length
// D) Width

// Res: A) Height
// Reason:

// Q-3 What is a complete binary tree?

// A) Each node has exactly zero or two children
// B) A binary tree, which is completely filled, with the possible exception of the bottom level, which is filled from right to left
// C) A binary tree, which is completely filled, with the possible exception of the bottom level, which is filled from left to right
// D) A tree In which all nodes have degree 2

// Res: C) A binary tree, which is completely filled, with the possible exception of the bottom level, which is filled from left to right
// Reason: Left to Right

// Q-4 What is the average case time complexity for finding the height of the binary tree?

// A) h = O(loglogn)
// B) h = O(nlogn)
// C) h = O(n)
// D) h = O(log n)

// Res: D) h = O(log n)
// Reason:

// Q-5 In a full binary tree if number of internal nodes is I, then number of leaves L are?

// A) L = 2*I
// B) L = I + 1
// C) L = I – 1
// D) L = 2*I – 1

// Res: B) L = I + 1
// Reason:

// Q-6 In a full binary tree if number of internal nodes is I, then number of nodes N are?

// A) N = 2*I
// B) N = I + 1
// C) N = I – 1
// D) N = 2*I + 1

// Res: D) N = 2*I + 1
// Reason:

// Q-7 Which of the following is incorrect with respect to binary trees?
// A) Let T be a binary tree. For every k ≥ 0, there are no more than 2k nodes in level k
// B) Let T be a binary tree with λ levels. Then T has no more than 2λ – 1 nodes
// C) Let T be a binary tree with N nodes. Then the number of levels is at least ceil(log (N + 1))
// D) Let T be a binary tree with N nodes. Then the number of levels is at least floor(log (N + 1))

// Res: D) Let T be a binary tree with N nodes. Then the number of levels is at least floor(log (N + 1))
// Reason:

// Q-8 In a complete k-ary tree, every internal node has exactly k children or no child. The number of leaves in such a tree with n internal nodes is:

// A) nk
// B) (n – 1) k+ 1
// C) n( k – 1) + 1
// D) n(k – 1)

// Res: C) n( k – 1) + 1
// Reason:

// Q-9 Height of Height of a binary tree is

// A) MAX( Height of left Subtree, Height of right subtree)+1
// B) MAX( Height of left Subtree, Height of right subtree)
// C) MAX( Height of left Subtree, Height of right subtree)-1
// D) None of the above

// Res: A) MAX( Height of left Subtree, Height of right subtree)+1
// Reason: +1 means Root node.

// Q-10: Suppose a complete binary tree has height h>0. The minimum no of leaf nodes possible in term of h is?

// A) 2h
// B) 2h-1
// C) 2h+1

// Res: B) 2h-1
// Reason:

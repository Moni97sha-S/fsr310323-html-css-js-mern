⏹️ Pseudo Elements:
   - Pseudo means fake (not real)
   1. :first-child we should use div's class name followed by <p> tag name when many same <p> tags r thr
   2. p:nth-of-type(2) means it makes sense of tag name only among <p> tag.
   3. p:nth-child(2) means it takes 2nd tag on whole div among <span>, <p> regardless of any tag name in between

⏹️ Responsive Design (RWD)
   - Layout: flex layout | 
   - Mobile responsive min. 400px means min-width:400px; property can be used in every parent div
   - According to user's screen size our content should adjust without any content loss
   - As we use pixels in general, we will loose the content if screen size changes. In order to overcome this issue, we use below vw & vh instead of px.
   <!-- Units -->
   - 
   - In order to be flexible, we use vh, vw, vmin etc.
   - viewport width (vw)
      > occupy available width & adjustable even when screen size shirnks or enlarges
   - viewport height (vh)
   - Note: we should not give display:inline in topnav
         > Don't give max-width in parent container

⏹️ Media Query
   - @media screen and (min-width:400px)
   <!-- properties -->
   - min-width
   - min-height
   - max-width property
   - max-height property
   - we can't give more than 1 max-width simply as it overrides.There is some condition
   - But my req 0 to 400px gives blue; after 400px to 800px gives gray; after 800px gives violet

⏹️ Animation rules / queries
   - @keyframes
      > in each frame by frame our rule works
⏹️ Animation properties
   - By default, gets back to original position / origin after animation 
   - animation-name:ABC;
      > we should name the animation to connect rules and html elements (tag), class, id etc inside CSS selectors
   - animation-duration:2s; | without above two property animation won't works
      > says for how long the animation should work
   - animation-timing function:ease-in-out | ease-in | ease-out | linear | ease;
      > we can also control the animation speed curve using this property
      > ease-in: starts slowly then go faster
      > ease-out: starts fastly then turns into slowly
      > ease-in-out: combination of above both values
   - animation-delay: 2s;
      > It delays the animation by 2 seconds.
   - animation-direction:alternate / reverse;
      > Assume that from (0%) we give bg-color as blue & in 100% complete to we give bg-color as coral
      > alternate means blue to coral, coral to blue etc.
      > reverse means starts from 100% to 0% like coral to blue
   - animation-iteration-count: 3 or infinite; 
      > work as loop
      > tells how many times animation should run
   - animation-fill-mode: forwards; | we can see animation stops at coral bg-color not in white bg-color
      > let's say we want to stay in the last state of animation
      > we need to stop from default reaching its default origin for that purpose we use this property
   - animation-play-state: paused;
      > used to pause/stops an animation state while hovering means mouse on div
      > when we remove it resumes/starts continuing animation
   - transform:rotateZ('angle');

⏹️ Assignment discussion
   - Favicon is used to display near title of file name
   - div class=container is given for wrap the different content in one division
   - To make the whole content in the center even when we ctrl- also.
   - Table can't take transitions and animations.
   - Responsive > Mobile first approach (in code 1st banner pic & then content)
   - Class can have 2 classnames
   - To bring a div has some width in order to bring center given margin:0 auto; for this only we given container class
⏹️ Box-sizing
   - box-sizing: border-box; inside Universal Selector
   - In above property, width & height is same & padding will adjust within given width
   - padding: 0 50px (TB LR); + width:100%
   - padding + width makes overflows of text & horizontal scrollbar is added 
   - padding + width = Actual width of this p becomes widht: 100% + 100px; (50px for left & 50px for right) 
   - so in order to overcome this problem consider above when padding is within the width

⏹ Difference between display, visibility & opacity
⏹ Aligning elements
   📌 using Text-align (most-commonly used)
      💡 if we have block element inside it inline element then use this property
   📌 using flex (commonly) | Go through website flexbox playground in codepen
      💡 when aligning multiple elements use this property.
      💡 can't make ur img outside of the box using this. In that case use position:relative;
      💡 display:flex; | always remain in center irrespective of changes in height, width
      💡 Responsive web-design for mobiles, tabs etc.
      💡 Supporting properties of flex are:
      💡 justify-content:right/center/left; | without this img gets left by default
      💡 align-items:start/center/end; | without this img gets enlarges
   📌 using position properties (rarely)
      💡 position: relative is used for parent & absolute is used for child
      💡 position: relative is used when img is used outside of the box container.
      💡 never use position:relative; for aligning items left & ri8
      💡 position:relative; is used only when position:absolute; is used
      💡 can't make ur img outside of the box using this. In that case use position:relative;

⏹ paragraph tag doesn't have left right margins by default. It is body's margin.

2nd May Topics
----------------
⏹ CSS Comments
⏹ Cascading meaning in CSS?
   📍 given to same tag elements
   📍 Overrides
   📍 Whatever property repeats with different value, then the last one that is given 1st priority
⏹ Box Model [CPBM in that order]
   📍 content ✅ Highlighted center 
   📍 padding (top, right, bottom & left ) ✅ space between the content and border (inner-space)
   📍 border ✅ between padding & margin
   📍 margin ✅ space outside of the element/border (outer-space)
⏹ Display properties
   📍 block ✅ Always starts with a new line & as div tag is block level element, it doesn't mean browser automatically add some space like a margin before and after the element
           ✅ takes 100% width relative to the parent
   📍 Inline ✅ takes space according to it's content
            ✅ padding, width, height will not work properly (overlaps) for inline element
   📍 Inline-block ✅ it makes overlaps in aligned manner
                  ✅ mix of inline & blocks | padding, width & height works properly
   📍 flex (layout ✅ nav, header, footer,  + align) / grid (layout)
⏹ Position properties
   📍 static ✅ by default value | (Ri8 Top Bottom Left - TRBL will not work)
   📍 relative ✅ relative & absolute always work together | (TRBL will work)
              ✅ element moves from its original position
   📍 absolute ✅ position is related to the parent
              ✅ TRBL will work, element move relative to the parent (having value relative)
   📍 none ✅ hide the content & remove the element space
   📍 fixed ✅ position is related to the browser
           ✅ position is fixed as top-nav bar and top button even we scroll it doesn't move
           ✅ here TRBL works
           ✅ element moves relative to the browser
           ✅ if no TRBL given by default 'go to top' button will be bottom-left out of the browser
Notes: Relative is for parent & absolute is for child
       Fixed position is by default outside of the browser window

⏹ Breakdown a website into pages
   - div by default in block level display
⏹ Descendent Selector: parent tag/class with its child name in css
⏹ div is a block level element so we need to change display element into flex
⏹ justify-content: space-between; > equal spacing between logo, list & icons
⏹ align-items: center; > vertically items get at center spacing
⏹ border-radius: 5px; > box's border at corners get rounded

----------------
⏹ User Interface - the look of the website (HTML & CSS)
⏹ User Experience- interaction of the website with user (JavaScript)
⏹ Back-end Development - JS with Node.js
⏹ In html tags, attributes are giving additional information to entire tag.
⏹ We always code attribute inside the opening tag.
⏹ property:text; pairs in CSS
⏹ Inline CSS Disadvantages: repeat same property-value pair for each & every tags slows down the website speed.
   > Style act as attribute
   > On highest priority condition, we use Inline CSS.
⏹ Internal CSS:
   - Style act as tag inside which we write internal CSS
   - No repetition as we call elements by tag name
   Disadvantages of Internal CSS:
   - Again slows down the run time as it reads code one line by line
   - Scrolling long codes creates chaotic for developer
⏹ External CSS:
   > link tag used to link once ur CSS file in HTML file (i.e) <link>
   > rel means relation between css & HTML is StyleSheet (i.e) rel="stylesheet"
   > type attribute informs HTML page what type of CSS file we are going to attach with HTML (i.e) type="text/css"
   > href attribute informs path of that CSS file in our system. (i.e) href="style.css"
⏹ class vary colors for particular tag among same name tags; prefer not to use - while in naming convention instead use _ or 2nd word capitalize 1st letter; called by .
⏹ id means individual identity; can't give same id repeatedly; is for single element styling; Called by #; prefer not to use - while naming instead use _ or 2nd word capitalize 1st letter

- To come out of folder in order to access img outside the html's folder use "../"


Why you should not use Google drive for assignment submissions:
Difference between google drive link & github link
- Download each file
- asset links (img) will break while using live server in google drive
- according to ur upload type like absolute or relative URL 
- u can't share ur 100% effort
- In GD, you can't update the code/folder without changing the link

Properties
1) Background
background-image
2) Overflow
For overflow to work we need to give width & height sometimes margin.
   - Overflow: hidden; This hides rest of img & takes only img size. cropped
   - Overflow: scroll; remaining space is scroll & see using scroll bar
   - Overflow: auto; means height is fulfill then overflow works which depends on image size.
   - Overflow:visible; means normal visibility
3) Transform 
It means change or tranformation
For transform to work we need to give width, height & on hover-effect only it works with random text to check if it works or not.
sometimes margin: 0 auto to bring it center,  background-color & 
display:flex, justify-content:center & align-items:center;
   - deg
   - tansform:rotateX(60deg), rotateY(180deg);
   - rotate: rotates the item

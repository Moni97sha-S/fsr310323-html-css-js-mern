        //Q-1 Which statements are true?

        //A) Javascript supports multiple inheritance
        //B) Javascript supports multi-level inheritance
        //C) Javascript doed not supports inheritance
        //D) Javascript supports both multiple and multi-level inheritance

        //Res:- (B) supports multi-level 
        //Reason:- Inheritance divided into three types: 
        /* Single Inheritance -> Every class can be extend from one parent class.
        Multiple Inheritance -> A class can inherit from multiple classes. ES6 doesnâ€™t support multiple inheritance.
        Multi-level Inheritance -> A class can inherit from another class (via) which inherit from the parent class. */
        
        //Q-2 Which statements are true?
        //A) Keys with non-function values are called Properties
        //B) Keys with function values are called Methods
        //C) Classes can be used to create more objects
        //D) Objects can only be created using classes
        
        //Res:- (A), (B) & (C)
        //Reason:- A JavaScript property is a member of an object that associates a key with a value. A JavaScript object is a data structure that stores a collection of properties.
        /* A property consists of the following parts:
            A name (also called a key), which is either a string or a symbol.
            A value, which can be any JavaScript value. A property that has a function as its value may also be called a method.
            Some attributes, which specify how the property can be read and written. A property may have the configurable, enumerable, and writable attributes. */

        
        //Q-3 Every object's proto property to parent class's constructor method. This creates a connection. What is it called?

        //A) Prototype Connection
        //B) Prototype Link
        //C) Prototype Flow
        //D) Prototype Chain
        
        //Res:- (D) Prototype Chain
        //Reason:- Object.__proto__ == arr.__proto__.__proto__._proto__ (arr.__proto__ == Array.prototype; object.__proto__ = null)

        //Q-4 What is the purpose of super method?

        //A) It converts the class to super class
        //B) It inherits the properties and methods from the parent class
        //C) It will initialize the parent class
        //D) It will remove the inheritance
        
        //Res:- (C) It will initialize the parent class
        //Reason:- super() will call parentClass's constructor

        //Q-5 Which statements are true for inheritance?

        //A) Child class inherits all the properties and methods of the parent class
        //B) Child class inherits all the properties and methods of the parent's parent class
        //C) Properties of parent class can be accessed inside child class and child class' object.
        //D) Methods of parent class can be accessed inside child class and child class' object
        
        //Res:- (A), (B), (C) & (D)
        //Reason:-
        
        //Q-6 Where does proto method of JavaScript's root/main Object class point to?

        //A) Undefined
        //B) Empty Object
        //C) Null
        //D) None
        
        //Res:- (C) Null
        //Reason:- object.__proto__ == arr.__proto__.__proto__._proto__ (arr.__proto__ == Array.prototype; object.__proto__ = null)
        
        //Q-7 Which statements are true for the following line of code?
        class Student {
            constructor(fName, lName){
                this.firstName = fName;
                this.lastName = lName;
            }
        }
        new Student();
        //A) New keyword will create an empty object
        //B) Student() will insert all the properties and methods inside the empty object
        //C) New keyword will create an object of type Student with all the properties and methods
        //D) None of the above statements are true 
        //Res:- (A) & (B)
        //Reason:-
        
        
        //Q-8 Which keyword is used to inherit a parent class to a child class?

        //A) Inherit
        //B) Parents
        //C) Extends
        //D) None of the above 
        //Res:- (C) Extends
        //Reason:- class childClass extends parentClass{}
        
        
        //Q-9 How can you make PUT and DELETE request in jQuery?

        //A) $.put()
        //B) $.delete()
        //C) $.ajax(type: "PUT")
        //D) $.ajax(type: "DELETE")
        //Res:- (C) & (D)
        //Reason:- API Call's type can be changed into PUT & DELETE in jQuery
        
        
        //Q-10 How to add a new element as first child to the parent element?

        //A) $.("selector").setFirstChild(newElem)
        //B) $.("selector").setFirstChildNode(newElem)
        //C) $.("selector").prepend(newElem)
        //D) $.("selector").append(newElem)
        //Res:- (C) $.("selector").prepend(newElem)
        //Reason:- Always prepend means first child & append means last child in jQuery
